<p>Hello, I'm Charisse. Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>
    I'm a web developer currently based in Berlin.
    My goal is to help create useful and intuitive interfaces
    all while making sure my code is nice and clean. Along the way,
    I share what I'm learning through this blog. It's been a hell of a ride since
    I first started learning how to code while working in my family's coffee shop in Italy,
    and I love every single part of it!

<ul>
    <li>draw on the biggest paper I can find while listening to medieval fantasy audiobooks</li>
    <li>I write my own novels. I wrote about 8 novels throughout my life
        and I plan on publishing at least one of them in a couple years.
    </li>
    <li>go outside! The area I live in is lined with green patches that leads to a forest.
        Whether I'm going for a run or just taking a short breather, nothing beats a couple hours spent around nature.
    </li>
    <li>Read, read, read! You'll find me with my head down
        on a book or online article on the train.
    </li>
</ul>
