title: 5 Lessons from Reading 3 UI/UX Books
---

I've been out of the blogging wagon for a long time -- but for a good reason! I was hired as a Junior UI Developer at [Small Improvements](https://www.small-improvements.com/) and have been living in Berlin since September. I'll skip everything about how I get hired for another post and focus more on the current topic.

As a (self-taught) developer who has only been coding for a year, I am aware that I have a huge knowledge gap. Aside from actual developer experience, I needed to be more knowledgeable in the job that I was hired for. Print and UI design has their similarities, but designing for a web application can range from being daunting or maybe even underwhelming until you knew exactly what you're doing. At least that was how it felt like to me before I knew its importance. So, 5 lessons, here we go.


#### C. R. A. P.

Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity -- the 4 basic principles of design.

#### Name it and its yours

The first chapter of The [Non-Designer's Design book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41597.The_Non_Designer_s_Design_Book) tells of a short story of the author having an epiphany about a certain type of tree that she had never seen before. The moral of it is that, once you can name something, you're conscious of it. You'll see it everywhere and you'll be in control. Name it and its yours.

#### Avoid UX debt

UX Debt is an accumulation of design and development decisions that negatively impact the users of a product or service and is either intentional or unintentional that can affect users in a way that they will seek out competitors. Things like slight changes to the stack or architecture will probably not affect your users very much, but will more likely affect the developers and their productivity -- this is technical debt. Visual debt, on the other hand, is more on the client side. Striving for consistency in the use of icons, typography and layout can build trust between the product and the users as well as avoiding confusion. It is helpful to be aware of these things when navigating through your product.

#### Every element on the page has to have a reason why its there

As we go about designing a web page, we must think about why we are placing an element on that particular spot. No element should be placed arbitrarily on a page. This helps me make better design decisions by asking myself questions when I'm designing or to be able to analyze designs made by others and give helpful feedback.

#### It's okay to break the rules -- If you know what you're doing

As we go about designing and follow the patterns that others have laid out upon us and what our users have grown accustomed to, we must remember that its okay to break the rules -- if you know what you're doing. The patterns are there for us to follow so that it would be easier for our users to adapt into our applications but these are rules that are not set in stone that if we do not follow, would be the end of the world. If you have a better idea and if you think that that idea is the best for your users, then go for it!

## Conclusion
After reading 3+ books, it felt like a new window opened up and all of a sudden I can see the inconsistencies in our app, and I can decide better than when I first started. Before, I thought that good design is a gift that not everyone can have but as I grow, I realize it can be learned. The eyes and the mind can be trained to see what is good design or not.
