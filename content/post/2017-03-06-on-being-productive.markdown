title: On Being Productive
---

I've read a lot of articles about productivity. I like to read them because they're motivating, promising satisfaction and a great sense of achievement. Sometimes they even introduce new apps or new methods, which are interesting discoveries on its own.

But a couple weeks back, I was looking at my to-do list and I realized that I had "so much to do" but at the end of the day, I still didn't feel productive. And for me, that was devastating because I keep pushing myself to do something -- anything -- just to make me feel like I've achieved something. That made the task less fun because I chased time and squeezed in so many things that are not so important but would have been good to get out of the way. But I was left drained, unhappy and didn't have any time left to play. So, here are my learnings.

#### Prioritise what is more important
Most of the time, we have "small" tasks like, grocery shopping, sending an email, etc. These things can easily add up and eat at least half of the day. Sure, crossing them off the list is a good feeling but what I've realized is that if I do them first, I am left with no time to do what I really wanted to do. So I do them last, or during breaks from the more important tasks.

#### Write down specific goals
I wrote down my long-term and short-term goals. There are no deadlines so I can focus on the steps to achieve it; not on the remaining time left. Some people would prefer to have a deadline because it pushes them to do more or finish early but I think its equally important to just enjoy the the feeling of being in a state of progress.

As an example, one of my short-term goals is to finish [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/). I'm not required to finish it but I would love to finish what I started. A long term goal would be to be able to speak in German. These are both in progress and deadline-free but I try to make sure that I get a little bit further than I did. That's good enough.

#### Plan for the next day
Now that I have a specific goal that I want to achieve, I plan for the next day with those goals in mind. The way that it works for me is that I write down 3 goal-related tasks, separated from the extra ones. They are the most important and what I would spend more time on, everything else can be done during breaks between these tasks. I find planning a good way to find order. Of course, sometimes things change, but that's okay.

## Conclusion

The greatest takeaway for me by doing this is that I am able to have more sense of achievement by doing less. I have time to breathe and play and still feel like I have progressed. It's important to keep in mind that you don't have to do everything all in one day. Celebrate the progress. In this era where everything is moving so fast, it's always okay to go slow.
