title: How I Picked Myself Up After a Big Disappointment
---

A couple months ago, I developed my own study plan to become a full stack developer. I collect a list of concepts that are personally interesting to me and group them as packages (or “modules”, as I’d like to call them). Each module would contain a week’s worth of learning material and exercises. At the end of the third month, I set myself a bigger challenge from which I would verify my knowledge based on the concepts that I learned about. But you can probably already tell from the title of this post that I had failed. Miserably.

Here's what I did (in order):

1. I recognized my feelings -- anger, disappointment, maybe even my ego was hurt.
2. After I've exhausted myself of my emotions, I reflected on how I got there.
3. Then find ways to improve.

At the end of that long day of trial and error, I finally walked away from the challenge, feeling defeated. It was a huge relief for me that I was able to let my feelings out because I know I was in a safe environment to feel vulnerable (in this case, I was just at home).

The difficult part was getting into a state where I can finally move forward. The feeling of failure always brings with it self-doubt. And perhaps that was even worse that feeling like a failure. It’s easy for me to get stuck on constantly feeling inadequate and I know myself well enough that I know that when something sucks, then everything else sucks too. So I take as much time as I need, and once I’ve calmed down (usually after sleeping on it), I try to focus on figuring out how I ended up in that situation. On some other ocassions, I tend to get over my failures quickly, but in this case, it both felt like a huge blow and a wake up call.

For that challenge, I asked myself a bunch of questions such as:

* Where did I get stuck on and why couldn’t I pull myself out?
* What exactly was I trying to do? Could I have made it simpler/better?
* Did I break down the problem correctly? Do I *even* understand the problem?
* Did I pick the correct learning materials/exercises that could have prepared me better for this challenge?

Knowing the root of the problem or areas that can be improved definitely pulled me out of feeling miserable because I can now formulate a plan on what needs to be changed. Having a plan is always motivating for me because it gives me a sense of direction, which reminds me of the metaphor of [Rudders and Oars](https://jamesclear.com/goal-setting#Rudders%20and%20Oars).

Of course, I don't assume that I will never make the same mistake again. I may haven’t done a very good job in that coding challenge but at this point what became more important for me was that I learned from that failure, dusted myself off and kept walking.
