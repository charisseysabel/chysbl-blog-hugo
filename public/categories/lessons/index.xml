      <description>I’ve been on both sides of the interview process. And although there is a lot to say on what to do and what not to do as a interviewee, I thought I’d share the lessons that I’ve learned as an interviewer so that designers, who are just getting started in the field, can get an idea on what goes into an interviewer’s mind.
These are all my opinions and may or may not be the same for every organization.</description>
