      <description>I would say that this year has been all about personal development. And as much as I wanted to level up more on the web development side, I think getting to know myself is also an important step that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t skip.
I wanted to be a lot of things and I felt confused about what I really want to be (and sometimes it still happens) and for some time I was convinced that I can be anything as long as I take the steps to get there.</description>
