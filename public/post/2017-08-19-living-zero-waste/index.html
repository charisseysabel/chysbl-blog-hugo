<p>Believe it or not, my Zero Waste journey started from a YouTube video. Watching TV has always been my family&rsquo;s way of bonding – we would sit on the couch with a bowl of dinner on our laps and watch videos of YouTubers playing and screaming while videogames (my mom is a huge fan of video games) or just re-watch Jack Black / Jim Carrey movies after a long day of work in the family&rsquo;s cafe.</p>

<p>But one night, there was a YouTube recommendation of TEDtalks and we so happen to come across a video with a clickbait title called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF72px2R3Hg&amp;t=423s">Why I live a Zero Waste Life</a>&rdquo;. We were so intrigued because its hard to just imagine living without any trash, let alone to actually live it. Every single thing that we purchase comes packaged in one way or another, so is it really possible?</p>

<p>As I was watching this video, I keep seeing our trash bin from the corner of my eye. It was overflowing with trash – from plastic, to baby diapers, to carton boxes wrapped in more plastic, to paper bags &ndash; down to a tiny freebie toy that comes from a bag of chips. I clean the house everyday and I take the trash out everyday as well and I can&rsquo;t help but feel good about having an empty trash can for a couple of hours. But where do those all trash go? There is a saying, &ldquo;Out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; and we basically do the same thing with our trash. Once its in the trash bin and the garbage man collects it and takes it away, its not our problem anymore&hellip;. right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I made a decision to change.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-live-zero-waste">What does it mean to live Zero Waste?</h2>

<p>According to Lauren Singer (the girl in the video):
&gt; Zero Waste means that I do not produce any garbage. No sending anything to landfill, no throwing anything in a trash can, nothing. However, I do recycle and I do compost.</p>

<p>This is what I aim for.
Nowadays, the only things that goes into my trash can are fallen hair, paper that I&rsquo;ve used both sides on, and organic waste (because we don&rsquo;t have brown bins in the building)</p>

<p>So the question now is, how can we actually reduce our trash?</p>

<h2 id="the-5-r-s-of-zero-waste">The 5 R&rsquo;s of Zero Waste</h2>

<p>According to Bea Johnson, the founder of the Zero Waste movement, we only have to follow 5 rules in order to live sustainably</p>

<h4 id="refuse-what-you-don-t-need">Refuse what you don&rsquo;t need</h4>

<p>Refuse paper bags, single-use plastic and disposables.
I also refuse freebies for example, in conferences. I went to a meetup where the company who was hosting it was giving a way a tote bag with freebies including a notebook, stickers, and a powerbank. It all seems like great things to have but as the meetup was progressing, I kept asking myself, &ldquo;Do I really need this?&rdquo; I have a powerbank that I can barely use, I already have 4 reusable tote bags, I have tons of paper to be upcycled into a notebook and I certainly don&rsquo;t find value in having that company&rsquo;s sticker.</p>

<h4 id="reduce-what-you-do-need">Reduce what you do need</h4>

<p>Reduce the clutter in your life by getting rid of things that don&rsquo;t give you value.
Yes, this might sound like you&rsquo;re giving your trash away to other people but you&rsquo;ll find that those things that you don&rsquo;t really need will give a ton of value to other people. For example, your clothes. How much of those do you actually wear and how much of those are actually just sitting in the back of the cabinet waiting for the &ldquo;perfect occasion&rdquo;?</p>

<p>I once bought a flowery skirt thinking that maybe one day I&rsquo;ll feel girly enough to wear it. I gave it away unused because that day never came. I didn&rsquo;t miss that skirt at all.</p>

<p>Strive to live minimally. Let go of the things that are laying around in your garage, cabinets, boxes, etc. We need less than we think we do.</p>

<h4 id="reuse-by-swapping-for-reusables">Reuse by swapping for reusables</h4>

<p>Some people say that if you&rsquo;re going Zero Waste, you have to start from scratch. People say that you need to have a stainless steel water bottle, a stainless steel or glass containers, etc. I think that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>

<p>Tupperwares may be made of plastic, but I don&rsquo;t feel the need to give it away because I can reuse it for a very long time. Anything that you already have and that can be reused like a water bottle, bento box, etc in place of disposable ones are good enough.</p>

<h4 id="recycle-what-you-cannot-refuse-reduce-or-reuse">Recycle what you cannot refuse, reduce or reuse</h4>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve refused, reduced, and reused most of your stuff, you&rsquo;ll find that you don&rsquo;t really have much to send to the recycling facility and that&rsquo;s great because let&rsquo;s face it – you can only recycle something a couple times.</p>

<p>When we send something to be recycled, often times those things get mixed in with other things in order for them to become new products and those products might not be recyclable anymore because it might not be possible to break its components down into reusable pieces and so eventually, they still go to the landfill. I&rsquo;ve heard / read things like &ldquo;paper can only be recycled 5 to 7 times&rdquo; and the more you recycle them, the more chemicals they need to be made into paper again :(</p>

<h4 id="rot-compost-the-rest">Rot (compost) the rest</h4>

<p>This is the part of living Zero Waste that I haven&rsquo;t yet achieved because I live in a shared flat without a garden nor a brown bin for organic waste. But I&rsquo;ve been looking for ways to change it, for example, joining a local community garden where I can bring my organic waste that can be mixed in soil that will serve as fertiliser. Maybe this time I can fulfill my dream of growing my own food. I might even learn some German farming words</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it! I found that once you follow these 5 principles, you&rsquo;ll soon earn its benefits.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-living-zero-waste">The Benefits of Living Zero Waste</h2>

<h4 id="helps-the-environment">Helps the environment</h4>

<p>You send little to nothing to the landfill, you reuse what&rsquo;s already out there and you don&rsquo;t contribute to the demand for things that reduces our natural resources.</p>

<h4 id="health-improvements">Health improvements</h4>

<p>When you live Zero Waste, its normal that you have to cook. And when you cook your own food with raw ingredients, you know what goes in it. You don&rsquo;t have products laying around with ingredients you can&rsquo;t even pronounce.</p>

<h4 id="more-freedom">More freedom</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just physical freedom of having more space. But also having the time to do what&rsquo;s more important.</p>

<h4 id="teaches-you-to-live-slow">Teaches you to live slow</h4>

<p>What does it mean to live slow?
We live in a world right now where everything demands our attention and we react by doing the same. When we live in the fast lane, we often overlook many things and we tend to get stressed faster and sometimes, we often fail to see that happiness or love is where we already are.</p>

<p>Once we start slowing down, we tend to become more mindful and we notice the things we haven&rsquo;t before. Our minds are free of clutter and we tend to become more grateful and energetic and less stressed and don&rsquo;t easily get &ldquo;bogged&rdquo; (is that a word?) down on the negative stuff.</p>

<h4 id="saves-you">Saves you $$$</h4>

<p>This is both a yes and no answer because frankly, some unpackaged stuff can be more expensive that their packaged friends. But remember: what you buy, you vote for.</p>

<p>It saves you money because 1: you spend waaaaaayyyy less than you did before and 2: you only spend for what needs to be replaced &ndash; a shirt that&rsquo;s too small, food, etc.</p>

<p>All these benefits sounds great, right? So how do you get started?</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to Get Started</h2>

<h4 id="first-look-at-your-trash">First, Look at your trash</h4>

<p>When you come home tonight, don&rsquo;t just mindlessly throw your trash in the bin. Look at it. See what&rsquo;s in there. You&rsquo;ll find that most of the things that you throw away are things that you can find alternatives for or maybe even stuff that you can live without.
If you don&rsquo;t know what your problem is, you can&rsquo;t find the solution for it.</p>

<h4 id="start-small">Start small</h4>

<p>As much as you want to live without trash from now on, change takes time. You want to introduce small changes in your life so that you don&rsquo;t overwhelm yourself and raise your hands one day and say, &ldquo;Nope, can&rsquo;t do this; it&rsquo;s too difficult&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Start forming a habit of skipping the aisle in the grocery store until you get used to it. Make it a habit to go to the bulk store every week. Change is hard but if you keep doing it, it will become easier and will become normal. It will become normal to refuse plastic. It will become normal to have reusable bags in your backpack for impromptu trips to the market.</p>

<p>The first thing that I quit was individually-wrapped chocolate (because I love chocolate and I used to eat a couple after every meal). Then I moved to using newspaper for picking up my dog&rsquo;s waste. Then I stopped buying juice and made my own (tastes so much better). Then it goes on and on and on.</p>

<h4 id="be-creative">Be creative</h4>

<p>There was a time when I was cooking almost the same meals every week and eventually I started getting the feeling that I&rsquo;m getting so tired of the taste of cauliflower. But it turns out that there&rsquo;s so many cauliflower recipes out there and the last cauliflower dish I cooked didn&rsquo;t taste like cauliflower at all. I made vegetarian meatballs out of cauliflower, quinoa and some rice. I&rsquo;ve never had quinoa before but I was so excited to try out something new.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re excited, you have fun. When you&rsquo;re having fun, what you do doesn&rsquo;t feel like a task.
Being creative also forces you to think of alternatives. Need an all-purpose cleaner? Make your own. Need to clean the windows? All you need is damp newspaper.</p>

<h4 id="stick-to-your-values">Stick to your values</h4>

<p>Living Zero Waste will constantly challenge you to refuse, reduce and reuse. At some point, I asked myself:
&ldquo;Why am I doing this again? Why should spend 2 hours of my day commuting back and forth to the bulk store when the supermarket is right around the corner and has everything that I need?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer: It&rsquo;s because I want to live in a way that aligns with my values. I value the environment (we all do in one way or another). I value my health and I value my family&rsquo;s health that&rsquo;s why I would go so far as buying something organic even if it costs a little more. Money is not the reason why I&rsquo;m living this way (but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t have a budget)</p>

<p>So get some alone time and try to get to know yourself because when the time comes that you have to make a decision, your values will help you decide if its the right thing to do.</p>

<h4 id="pay-it-forward">Pay it forward</h4>

<p>If you know someone who might be interested in this idea, tell it to them. You don&rsquo;t have to tell them that they should do it but rather, help them become aware of this idea. I shared this lifestyle to everyone because I realised that I can&rsquo;t save the world on my own.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have to wait for a climate change agreement. Change starts from us. Change starts from our home and the more other people see the good changes in our lives, the more likely they will be inspired to try it out.</p>
