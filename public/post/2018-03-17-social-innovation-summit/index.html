<p>Sustainability has always been an important topic in my life. But if I&rsquo;m being honest, I don&rsquo;t really know much about it. I know the general concept, but not much beyond that. That is why I was so stoked about this conference. I learned that sustainability is part of something much bigger: social innovation.</p>

<p>One of the sessions that I attended was a refugee crisis-related technology. Ben Mason of <a href="http://www.betterplace-lab.org/en/">betterplace-lab.org</a> talked about what went wrong with the handful of application startups that closed its doors in Germany alone. It was a little bit sad to hear because a lot of these applications have a very novel goal in mind; they wanted to help, but the rise of applications that do the exact same thing only gave room for competition that is not needed. There was a huge lack of resources and the intended users of the app had a lower digital literacy than what they expected.</p>

<p>But despite all of these challenges, Ben gave some reasons to be optimistic. After a year of  research, we now have an idea on what worked and what didn’t. In developing refugee crisis-related applications, one must create a partnership with organisations that are in the field because they are the ones who are in direct contact with them. Or better yet, we should talk to our intended users and find out exactly what they need.</p>

<p>One of the other sessions that I attended to (and personally, my favorite) was about consumerism and responsibility. The format of the panel was very interesting. The setup of the room had several chairs forming a circle around 4 main chairs. The moderators Alyssa McDonald-Bärtl and Prof. André Reichel occupied 2 of the main chairs, and the other chairs were left vacant for the audience, who wish to speak, to occupy. The only rule was that one of the chairs should always be vacant so that the speakers always change. I personally liked this discussion because it allowed the audience to talk to each other.</p>

<p>The discussion argued that consumers cannot be responsible on their own and people cannot be live sustainably if the ecological option is not there. But once we produce stuff ourselves, then we are an enemy of capitalism. The Professor also argued that there’s a limit on how much you can opt out of consumerism and that we should accept the fact that we are political actors and activists. The discussion went on from environmental sustainability-related apps, to zero waste living, to producing and selling cacao, etc., one hour was not enough for everyone to give their opinion. But all in all, it was very informative.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://sisummit.de/">SIS summit</a> was a very informative conference for me, even though I only got to attend the first day. I learned a lot, I met some really interesting people, and even discovered new apps and services that I have yet to try out. It opened my eyes a little bit more about what social innovation is about and how my actions and values fit in the picture.</p>
