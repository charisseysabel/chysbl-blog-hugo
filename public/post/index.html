        Simple Trello Replica using React [Part 1]

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Trello has been one of my favorite productivity apps because of its straightforwardness and the amount of things that you can do with such a simple interface. I wanted to experiment, so I created a simple drag and drop component in React that imitates Trello&rsquo;s functionality using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API.
Prerequisites  Basic knowledge of React Node and NPM installed create-react-app for a fast setup.  What&rsquo;s in the Drag and Drop API?

      Sustainability has always been an important topic in my life. But if I&rsquo;m being honest, I don&rsquo;t really know much about it. I know the general concept, but not much beyond that. That is why I was so stoked about this conference. I learned that sustainability is part of something much bigger: social innovation.
One of the sessions that I attended was a refugee crisis-related technology. Ben Mason of betterplace-lab.

        Increase Color Contrast in React with CSS Custom Properties

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I’ve heard of CSS Custom Properties before, although I didn’t think about using it until I came across a problem: how can I change styles dynamically if CSS Preprocessors do not support it?
Motivation One of the most convenient features of a CSS Preprocessors is the fact that you can create variables, much like the same way as how you declare a variable in other programming languages. It makes our lives easier by following the DRY principle.

      I would say that this year has been all about personal development. And as much as I wanted to level up more on the web development side, I think getting to know myself is also an important step that I shouldn&rsquo;t skip.
I wanted to be a lot of things and I felt confused about what I really want to be (and sometimes it still happens) and for some time I was convinced that I can be anything as long as I take the steps to get there.

      I’ve been on both sides of the interview process. And although there is a lot to say on what to do and what not to do as a interviewee, I thought I’d share the lessons that I’ve learned as an interviewer so that designers, who are just getting started in the field, can get an idea on what goes into an interviewer’s mind.
These are all my opinions and may or may not be the same for every organization.

        A Gentle Introduction to CSS Grid
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I wanted to take a look at CSS Grid for quite a while, so I rebuilt an old project using it.
CSS Grids allow us to design a layout in a 2-dimensional style: horizontally and vertically. Unlike flexbox, which is only focused on only 1 dimension.
I must admit that I was a bit hesitant about the idea of Grid because of the fact that flexbox has solved the problems that I faced with layouts today (at least most of them anyway).

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      So what exactly is Test-Driven Development?
Based on my understanding after reading a couple articles, Test-Driven Development (TDD) is the process by which you write tests for your code to make sure that it works as expected. You do this even before you start to write a single line of code and then you allow your code to adapt to the test and make it pass. The benefit of it is that it helps keep your code clean and do what it’s supposed to do.

      Sometimes we just need to remind ourselves why we want to dive into the world of blogging.
3 things, here we go.
What is your goal? It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind why you want to start / started blogging in the first place. I firmly believe that this will help you keep going during those times when you feel like you want to quit.
My purpose for this blog is to be able to explain things to myself — as selfish as that sounds.

      Believe it or not, my Zero Waste journey started from a YouTube video. Watching TV has always been my family&rsquo;s way of bonding – we would sit on the couch with a bowl of dinner on our laps and watch videos of YouTubers playing and screaming while videogames (my mom is a huge fan of video games) or just re-watch Jack Black / Jim Carrey movies after a long day of work in the family&rsquo;s cafe.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Task runners are great for automating tasks. Small, repetitive tasks such as minifying, uglifying or even just watching our files for changes can easily take up our time.
I’ve read some articles online that says automation was once done using shell scripts. I haven’t really tried that myself (but now I’m really curious) but now that frontend technologies have evolved drastically these past few years, task runners like Gulp and Grunt took our frontend environment another step forward.
