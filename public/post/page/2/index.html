      Have you ever failed to reach a goal? Like so many other people out there, I too, have set a goal for myself and in one way or another, failed to reach that goal on a set date.
This is a blogpost outlining the talk that I have given at Women Who Code Berlin.
So what exactly are goals? People have different definitions about it but for me, goals are the things or the outcomes that we want to achieve in life.

        Up and Running with Webpack

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      One of the most important things you have to have in your toolkit these days is the ability to use Webpack — and for a good reason. Webpack is a module bundler. It takes your assets — your JS files, CSS, images, etc — and outputs it as a single file, saving you with tons of trips back and forth from the server.
I gotta admit, the first time I’ve set up my own Webpack configuration file, I was pretty stoked and nervous and overwhelmed at the same time.

      In the previous post, we used the XMLHttpRequest object which is a very simple and basic way of requesting data from the server. Recently, the ECMAScript 6 introduced a new API called Promises in the hopes of making asynchronous requests more pleasant. We’re gonna take a look at what Promises are and understand them through a little bit of an exercise.
What are Promises? I have to admit that when I first heard someone say, “It returns a Promise”, I immediately go blank.

        Synchronous and Asynchronous Requests in Javascript

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      There are 2 types of requests that can Javascript can make: Synchronous and Asynchronous. But what is the difference between the two? And how do you make such requests?
The difference between synchronous and asynchronous requests can be best explained by one of the comments from Stack Overflow:
 SYNCHRONOUS
You are in a queue to get a movie ticket. You cannot get one until everybody in front of you gets one, and the same applies to the people queued behind you.

      I&rsquo;ve read a lot of articles about productivity. I like to read them because they&rsquo;re motivating, promising satisfaction and a great sense of achievement. Sometimes they even introduce new apps or new methods, which are interesting discoveries on its own.
But a couple weeks back, I was looking at my to-do list and I realized that I had &rdquo;so much to do&rdquo; but at the end of the day, I still didn&rsquo;t feel productive.

      I&rsquo;ve been out of the blogging wagon for a long time &ndash; but for a good reason! I was hired as a Junior UI Developer at Small Improvements and have been living in Berlin since September. I&rsquo;ll skip everything about how I get hired for another post and focus more on the current topic.
As a (self-taught) developer who has only been coding for a year, I am aware that I have a huge knowledge gap.
